# Beauty Mark

# Description
Beauty Mark is a web application that allows users to search and add makeup products to their makeup bag. Once the user has collected makeup products in their bag on the Face page, they are able to view any harmful ingredients their products may have. By clicking on the harmful ingredients, the user can learn more information about the risks. The user can also learn more about the risks in makeup products that they may want to avoid when buying future products on the Learn More page.
